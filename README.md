# AHP_Inconsistency_In_Comparison_Matrix
This project was created for master thesis. It's related with Analytic Hierarchy Process and matrix comparison. 
I implemented the algorithm for making the comparison matrix more consistent. In this application we can fill the comparison matrix by ourselves or we can also choose random matrix. 
There is the option to show chosen matrix and to compute Koczkodaj index for it. The last option is to look at results of inconsistency process, how it changes for particular matrix.
I also created the class for creating the file, where I want to save the results for analysis.
